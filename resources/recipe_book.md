Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.
Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter or some oil. When it's melted, add a ladle of batter per pancake. It will seem very thick but this is how it should be. Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, then turn it over and cook until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm (½in) thick.
Repeat until all the batter is used up. Keep the pancakes warm in a low oven

Golden Syrup - 3:5 cake:syrup (75:125)

Butter the inside of a 1.2-litre pudding basin. If you’re steaming the pudding on the hob, boil the kettle and have a large saucepan with a lid and a heatproof saucer ready. Cut a sheet of foil and greaseproof paper, both about 30cm long, and butter the greaseproof.

Spoon 3 tbsp syrup into the bottom of the basin. Lay 5 slices of clementine or satsuma in the bottom, overlapping like petals. Beat eggs. Then, in a bowl, beat the butter and sugar until creamy, then add eggs gradually, beating all the while, until light and fluffy. Add a spoonful of flour if the mix starts to split. Tip in the breadcrumbs and the rest of the flour, fold until combined, then add all remaining ingredients and fold again. Spoon mix on top of the fruit slices. Add remaining slices of clementine or satsuma against the side of the bowl as you go.

To cook on the hob, cover with greaseproof and foil and steam for 1½ hrs (see Know-how, below). To microwave, losely cover with cling film, pierce once, then cook on Medium for 12 mins. To check it’s done, poke a skewer into the pudding; it should come out clean.
Make the syrup by heating the ingredients in a small pan. When the pudding is ready, turn out and serve drenched with syrup, or leave to cool and chill for up to 3 days. To reheat, re-cover with foil and greaseproof and steam for 30 mins, or cover with cling film and microwave on Medium for 5 mins until hot. Reheat sauce in the microwave or in a pan.
